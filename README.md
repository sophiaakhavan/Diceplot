# Diceplot
Runs n (given by user) experiments, where each experiment rolls 4 dice and adds them up, prints histogram showing how many times each sum occurred (so in total it prints out n of the X symbols). Uses random number generator for the rolls, and function definitions for roll() and printHistogram(). Result is an output of a normal distribution/bell curve of X's.
